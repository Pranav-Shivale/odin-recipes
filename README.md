Recipes is a website where you'll get to know about various kinds of food and their recipes.
You'll get to know a brief description about the food, also what are the ingredients used, and
a step by step guide on how to actually make it.

Whilst working on and after completing the project, I feel I've grasped the basics of HTML with concepts such as lists - unordered and ordered, links, images and dealing with text, and
how to actually use those concepts in the project. The most important skill I learned would be
the basics of git and how to practically use it to my benefit.
