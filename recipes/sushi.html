    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Uramaki sushi (also called “inside out roll”) is a sushi roll made of sushi rice,
        filling and a sheet of nori seaweed, rolled so that the nori is on the inside and
        the rice is on the outside. The filling often consists of 2 or 3 different ingredients.
        On top of the rice you will often find Massago, Tobiko or sesame seeds.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Moisten the inside of a sushi rice mixing bowl or a large bowl to prevent the rice from sticking. The
                rice needs to be freshly cooked and hot when preparing sushi rice. Place the 660g cooked japanese rice
                in the bowl and add the 50ml sushi vinegar. Gently mix the vinegar into the rice using a rice paddle
                until the vinegar is well incorporated. Let the sushi rice cool down to room temperature. Cover the
                sushi rice with a moistened tea towel to prevent the rice from drying out.
            </p>
        </li>

                Cut the1 sheet nori seaweed into halves, and then place half of the nori on the sushi mat shiny side
                down. As a golden rule, the shiny side of the nori seaweed should always be on the outside of the sushi.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Place roughly 110g of sushi rice on the nori seaweed and spread across evenly. Place the sprig of dill
                on the rice. Flip the nori seaweed and sushi rice so that the nori seaweed is facing upward. Add a small
                portion of wasabi and place the two strips of cucumber and sashimi grade fish in the centre. Start
                rolling from the bottom, tucking the edge of the roll to fully enclose the filling. Lift the edge of the
                mat and continue to roll forward until the sushi is formed into a firm cylinder.

            <p>
                Slightly wet the blade of a sharp knife and slice the roll into 6 pieces. First, slice it into halves
                and then the halves into thirds. Clean the knife with a wet towel between cuts to prevent the rice from
                sticking to the knife.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Serve with soy sauce. Feel free to garnish with other foods such as white / black sesame seeds, tobiko,
                chives, etc.
