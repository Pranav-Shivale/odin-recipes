    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Uramaki sushi (also called “inside out roll”) is a sushi roll made of sushi rice, 
        filling and a sheet of nori seaweed, rolled so that the nori is on the inside and 
        the rice is on the outside. The filling often consists of 2 or 3 different ingredients. 
        On top of the rice you will often find Massago, Tobiko or sesame seeds.
