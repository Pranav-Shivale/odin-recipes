    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A carnitas taco is a traditional Mexican dish featuring succulent, 
        slow-cooked pulled pork that is tender, juicy, and has delicious crispy, 
        caramelized edges. The pork is typically nestled in a warm corn tortilla and
        topped with simple, fresh garnishes. The process takes three to four hours, 
        and the result is very tender and juicy meat, which is then typically served 
        with chopped cilantro, diced onion, salsa, guacamole, tortillas, and refried beans.
